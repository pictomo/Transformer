# Transformer
Transformer is a script, which rewrites the self into another form like the Transformers(of the story).
A code that itself goes back and forth between two (or more) states each time it is executed.

It is inspired by [quine (self replicating code)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)).
